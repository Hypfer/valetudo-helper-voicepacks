## Valetudo helpers

Valetudo helpers are a series of small standalone self-contained single-purpose single-file tools built to make
usage and/or installation of Valetudo a bit easier.

As with everything Valetudo, some intermediate computer skills are required. You should know what a network is,
what HTTP is, how a terminal works and that kind of stuff.
Please understand that it's not feasible for this or any open source project to provide basic computer lessons.
